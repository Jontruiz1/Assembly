	COMMENT !
		Write the code necessary to input an 
		hours worked and a rate of pay from the console.
		Call an internal procedure to calculate total pay.
		From the main routine, display the total pay on the
		console. The following additional rules apply:

		Use appropriate prompts to tell the user what to enter.

		Use appropriate output messages to indicate the calculation 
		that was performed
		
		You may assume that all values are integers.

		For the calc of total pay, if hours worked are <= 40, total pay
		= hours * rate. If hours >= 40, first 40 hours are calculated as
		regular pay as indicated above and hours over 40 hours are triple time,
		i.e hours worked times rate of pay times 3
